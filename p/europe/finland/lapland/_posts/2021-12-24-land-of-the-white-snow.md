This Christmas we went to a particularly beautiful place. Finland, full of snow and without people, has been very successful in escaping the Dutch _winter_ üåßÔ∏èüåßÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è. Rather than heading for a summer destination, we opted for a completely opposite experience with cold weather, deer, huskies, and the Northern Lights.

  Lapland is the northernmost region of Finland with the most of it located above the Arctic circle. The capital is Rovaniemi but we decided to go to Kittil√§ instead.

  A fun fact. The coldest day ever in the region was on 28th January, 1999. It was -51.5 ¬∞C that day.

  Out goal wasn't to get frozen though. We wanted to see the winter wonderland.

  Hills and lakes, deers and huskies, perfect weather and untouched nature. Let's just enjoy the snow for a couple of photos without me talking.

  Enjoy :) The gallery is clickable, btw.

  The only way you can hike in that much snow is by using snow shoes.
  I actually thought that snow shoes are actually some kind of special wide boots but they turned to be attachments to your normal boots.

  Another cool way of moving around is a snowmobile. It's fast and powerful and, given you can drive it, easily moves you in any remote place to see even more snow there :)

  Inna likes it! By the way, we had to put extra layers against the wind. In total, I think, we had 7 layers of clothes on us that day.

  When night comes, it gets dark (what a surprise, right?). A day begins at roughly 10am and end around 3pm.
