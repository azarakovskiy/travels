This one is a preview style `full-padding` with height `half`,
image on the `right`, and the image is aligned to the `center` which is a *default* value.
Content is in a `center` and the `bgcolor` is set to `black`.
<br><br>
It also controls how the content appears on the page by setting `onscroll-content-fade-left` and `onscroll-image-fade-in`
