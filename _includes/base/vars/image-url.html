/*
  This var translates a relative path to an image to a full-ish URL that can resolve an image.

  It expects a list of nested `folders` (categories in Jekyll terms, assigned automatically)
  and `image` which would a relative to `./..` path to an image.

  It results in a variable `image_url` containing an URL.
